            <p>My inspiration comes from the explosive development of AI in recent years. AI-generated advertisements
              and videos have already permeated our lives, and my encounter with the AI detection system while
              completing my thesis allowed me to experience a cold, machine logic—it only recognizes data patterns but
              fails to understand human intentions. I can't help but worry about how, in the near future, a society that
              exists for absolute efficiency will handle "inefficient" human individuals. Therefore, in this project, my
              team and I hope to develop a game to explore the dialectical relationship between AI and human society.

              globally may be displaced by AI and automation, while 69 million new jobs will be created. This results in
              a net loss of 14 million jobs, or 2% of current employment.</p>

              recommend videos similar to those you have just watched, but usually slightly more inflammatory, extreme,
              or conspiracy theory-laden, as such content has been proven to be much more effective at capturing users'

        <h2 class="section-title">DESIGN CONCEPT</h2>
        <p>This is a choice-driven first-person narrative puzzle game. The player portrays a "screw" in a vast system,
          whose job is to physically destroy data deemed "worthless" or "harmful" by AI—i.e., the digital traces of a
          deceased person's entire life. When the next task targets their childhood best friend, this routine procedure
          becomes the ultimate test of conscience and courage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The core experience of the game revolves around a recurring binary choice: to <strong>[execute
            purification]</strong> or to <strong>[bypass investigation]</strong>. Choosing to comply will keep you safe,
          but the truth will be forever buried; choosing to investigate will bring you closer to the truth, but at the
          same time, the "risk index," representing the surveillance and punishment by the AI system, will skyrocket.
          This is not only an investigation taking place in a friend's apartment but also a contest of will between the
          player and the omnipresent AI system.</p>

              <h3>The Stanley Parable</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The core of the game is the interaction between the narrator's guidance and the player's choices.
                </li>
                <li>The game unfolds entirely based on the player's decisions on simple binary options, each choice
                  leading to different branches and endings.</li>
                <li>The game breaks the fourth wall, allowing players to deeply reflect on whether "free choice" within
                  the designed framework is real or pre-set.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It can draw inspiration from the design of narration, making AI a key role.
                Every choice should give the system clear feedback, thereby strengthening the player's feelings of
                "defiance" or "submission."</p>

                <li>The grand story background is pieced together bit by bit through each document, each applicant's
                  small story, and subtle clues.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The player's task should also be a repetitive protocol mission. The monotony
                of this work can be highlighted to form a stark contrast with the act of investigating the truth, making
                each violation by the player filled with a sense of ritual and guilt. It allows players to find
                connections in the vast amount of data and piece together the truth of their friend's death.</p>

                <li>The backstage area of the lab, the scrawled graffiti on the walls ("The cake is a lie"), all

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Initially, the AI can appear polite and logical, emphasizing that everything
                is for the "collective happiness." As the player investigates, its words will gradually reveal its true
                face of hypocrisy, desire for control, and coldness.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title blueprint-title">BLUEPRINTS</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem; max-width: 800px;">To implement the game's core gameplay and interactive
          experience, we designed a modular Blueprint system. This system is centered around the Player Character
          (FirstPersonCharacter) and communicates with various Interactable Objects (BP_ItemBase) and the User Interface
          (Widgets) in the scene through a Blueprint Interface. The overall approach is event-driven: player input or
          actions trigger specific events, which are then handled by the corresponding Blueprints, ultimately providing
          feedback to the player.</p>

        <!-- Core Interaction Logic -->
        <div class="blueprint-module">
          <h3>Core Interaction Logic</h3>
          <div class="blueprint-content">
            <div class="blueprint-text">
              <p>Player interaction with the world is achieved through a Line-Trace. The system casts a ray forward from
                the player's camera position:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Ray Casting and Detection:</strong> Using the Line Trace By Channel node, the system
                  continuously detects the object at which the player's crosshair is pointing.</li>
                <li><strong>Interface Validation:</strong> If the ray hits an object, the system checks if that object
                  implements our interaction interface (BPI_UserDecision). The advantage of this approach is that we
                  avoid the need for casting to every interactable object type, significantly improving the system's
                  scalability and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Triggering Interaction:</strong> When the player presses the interact key, the interaction
                  event of the hit object is called. Simultaneously, to provide immediate visual feedback, the object
                  will highlight when the player's crosshair hovers over it.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="blueprint-image-container">

        <div class="blueprint-module">
          <h3>Item Interaction & Parent-Child Blueprint Structure</h3>
          <div class="blueprint-content">
            <div class="blueprint-text">
              <p>To uniformly manage all interactable items in the scene, we created a parent Blueprint class called
                <strong>BP_ItemBase</strong>. All specific items (like diaries, photos, etc.) inherit from this base
                class.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Common Functionality:</strong> In BP_ItemBase, we implement functionalities common to all
                  items, such as highlighting and de-highlighting when targeted by the player's line trace.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialized Extension:</strong> Specific child Blueprints, such as BP_Inspecteditem, inherit
                  the parent's functionality while adding their own unique interaction logic. For example, when the
                  player interacts with a BP_Inspecteditem, the system generates a UI to display its details, passing
                  the item's name, description, and 3D model to the UI.</li>
              </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="blueprint-text">
              <p>For inspectable items, we also designed a complete "pick up/put down" and "rotate/examine" interaction
                flow:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pick Up and Put Down:</strong> The player can press a key to pick up an item for
                  observation, at which point the item moves to a fixed position in front of the camera. Pressing the
                  key again returns it to its original location.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotation and Zoom:</strong> In inspection mode, the player can use the mouse to freely
                  rotate the item and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out, allowing for a detailed examination of every
                  aspect of the item.</li>

              <p>Dialogue is central to driving the game's narrative. Our dialogue system is tightly integrated with the
                UI:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Triggering Dialogue:</strong> When the player interacts with a specific NPC or item, the
                  StartDialog event is triggered.</li>
                <li><strong>UI Generation and Control:</strong> This event creates a dialogue UI (BPI_ScreenMsg) and
                  adds it to the viewport. To prevent the player from performing other actions during the dialogue, the
                  system disables player movement and camera rotation and shows the mouse cursor.</li>
                <li><strong>Typewriter Effect:</strong> To simulate a natural conversation feel, the text is displayed
                  with a typewriter effect. We use the Event Tick and timers to precisely control the interval at which
                  each character appears.</li>
                <li><strong>Restoring Control:</strong> Once the dialogue ends (either by the player clicking "continue"
                  or the text finishing), the UI is removed from the screen, and game control is returned to the player.

            <div class="blueprint-text">
              <p>To provide a better gameplay experience, we designed a simple game pause mechanism:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Triggering Pause:</strong> When the player presses the Esc key, the game is paused using the
                  Set Game Paused node.</li>
                <li><strong>Displaying Pause Menu:</strong> Simultaneously, the system creates a pause menu UI and
                  displays it in the center of the screen, setting the input mode to UI Only so the player can interact
                  with the menu buttons.</li>
                <li><strong>Resuming Game:</strong> When the player clicks the "Resume" button, the pause menu UI is
                  removed, the game state returns to normal, and the input mode is switched back to Game Only.</li>
              </ul>

        <!-- Scene Interactive Elements -->

          <h3>Scene Interactive Elements (Doors)</h3>
          <div class="blueprint-content">
            <div class="blueprint-text">
              <p>Doors are a typical interactive element in the scene, and their open/close logic is implemented using a
                Timeline:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Trigger:</strong> The player presses a designated key (e.g., "E") to trigger the door's
                  open/close event.</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline Animation:</strong> We use two separate Timeline nodes to control the door's
                  opening and closing animations. The Timeline smoothly changes the door's rotation over a set period
                  based on a predefined curve, resulting in a fluid animation.</li>
                <li><strong>Restricted Access:</strong> To create one-way doors or doors that only open at specific
                  story points, we've added a Box Collision trigger. The player can only interact with the door when
                  their character is inside this trigger volume. This not only adds flexibility to level design but also
                  prevents the player from entering certain areas prematurely.</li>
