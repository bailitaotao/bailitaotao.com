                        Dive into the intricate world of microprocessor design with our dynamic card game! Assemble core components like Registers, ALUs, and Control Units, and enhance your processor with essential and non-essential components. Strategically use command and energy cards to optimize your design, aiming for victory by creating the ultimate microprocessor architecture.

                    <p>
                        My design approach integrates traditional set-collection mechanics with educational content, inspired by games like Mahjong, Set, and Splendor. By balancing strategic decision-making with the principles of microprocessor design, the game uniquely illustrates the trade-offs and benefits of different components. This blend of strategy and education not only engages players but also serves as an accessible introduction to the fundamentals of how microprocessors work.

                    By incorporating strategic decisions that magnify the trade-offs and benefits of each card, the game offers a nuanced simulation of microprocessor design. In an era where computing devices are indispensable, this game serves as an educational tool for those newly exploring the fundamentals of computer operations.

                <h2>Inspiration: Mahjong</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the traditional Chinese board game Mahjong, this card game draws parallels to the microprocessor principles I studied during my undergraduate years. Just as Mahjong requires forming specific tile sets, this game involves combining core and component cards to build a basic computing micro chip.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Mahjong's set formation mechanics, strategic depth, and balance of trade-offs significantly influenced my design. The combination in Mahjong inspired the core mechanic of forming sets of cards to simulate microprocessor assembly. Its strategic decision-making and risk vs. reward dynamics informed the game's strategic elements, where players must carefully manage their cards.
