          <div class="game-item" data-description="Overwatch + PUBG -- a nice fps game but poorly managed."><img src="/assets/about/pc-games/apex-legend.webp" alt="Apex Legends"></div>
          <div class="game-item" data-description="I've loved playing SimCity on my iPod touch since I'm 8. The numerical design is awesome. Every time I messed up my city, I would ask my mom to help me play (Shouldn't expect too much from a primary school student). She's a stock market expert, so she could easily turn the finance problem into good situation. Back to the point—Skylines is more of a true sim, which is exactly what I need now that I’m older."><img src="/assets/about/pc-games/cities-skyline-2.webp" alt="Cities: Skylines II"></div>
          <div class="game-item" data-description="The graphics are probably the best among all games since 2020. Nowadays, most devs are too lazy to optimize—their games look mediocre but eat up so many resources. Huge props to CDPR. Even thought it was basically an unfinished mess when it first dropped, but it's still a masterpiece despite the flaws."><img src="/assets/about/pc-games/cyberpunk-2077.webp" alt="Cyberpunk 2077"></div>
          <div class="game-item" data-description="Solitude, life, reincarnation, and connection—this has to be the most polarizing game ever. If you can't settle in and really feel the story, it's just a boring &quot;delivery sim.&quot I'm usually a wimp when it comes to horror things, but the horror elements in Death Stranding don't scare me at all. That's because the core of the story is all about finding hope in isolation and reconnecting people."><img src="/assets/about/pc-games/death-stranding-director's-cut.webp" alt="Death Stranding Director's Cut"></div>
